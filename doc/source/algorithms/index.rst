Algorithms
==========

One of the reasons why I started writing this package is that I was looking for
a way to try out new algorithms that I would have read about in the `Sutton &
Barto RL book <http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html>`_. So, my
goal was to make the process of adding an algorithm is simple as possible and
to make it completely separate from the code that does function approximation.

The way to add an algorithm should be easy. To look at the algorithms I
implemented so far, click the source code button on the class definitions
below.
