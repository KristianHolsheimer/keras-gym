Cartpole TD(0) with Linear Function Approximator
================================================

In this notebook we solve the `CartPole-v0 <https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/>`_ environment using the following TD(0) algorithms:

- :class:`skgym.algorithms.QLearning`
- :class:`skgym.algorithms.Sarsa`
- :class:`skgym.algorithms.ExpectedSarsa`

Our Q-function uses scikit-learn's :class:`SGDRegressor <sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor>` as its underlying function approximator.

.. note::

    One of the function approximators in this notebook is a *type-II* model instead of the default type-I, which models the Q-function as a mapping :math:`s\mapsto Q(s,.)` rather than :math:`(s, a)\mapsto Q(s, a)`.

    I didn't have a lot of success getting this to converge properly. In other words, please don't expect consistent performance on CartPole with this specific function approximator. Having said that, I do expect type-II models to be able to outperform type-I ones on some other environments (perhaps environments with a larger action space).
