Environments
============

The environments included in here are typically those that depend on
the specific structure of the scikit-gym package. In particular, the first such
environment we include is the :class:`ConnectFour
<skgym.environments.ConnectFour>`, which requires the definition of an
adversary policy, for which we use the skgym convention.
