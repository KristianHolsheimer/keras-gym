Environments
============

The environments included in here are typically those that depend on
the specific structure of the keras-gym package. In particular, the first such
environment we include is the :class:`ConnectFour
<keras_gym.environments.ConnectFour>`, which requires the definition of an
adversary policy, for which we use the keras_gym convention.
